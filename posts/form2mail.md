title: Form to mail, sneak peek at new projects
---

We have yet to properly document the feature, but you can now create forms that send emails to the address of your choosing. Some details [on Pierre's blog](https://nothing.pcarrier.com/posts/form2mail/).

Started prototyping a mailing list turning blog. Still very early days, and might not get anywhere. Again some details [on Pierre's blog](https://nothing.pcarrier.com/posts/xit/).

Also thinking of building a web-based (Monaco-powered), offline-first editor, so anyone can write HTML and CSS and start a site without any installs. Either directly from the admin UI, or possibly on another domain altogether. This requires the API surface for `xmit download`, which gives it a new sense of urgency.
