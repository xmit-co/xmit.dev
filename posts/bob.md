[onclebob.com](https://onclebob.com) just launched.

Keeping this brief, but it feels like a milestone: Oncle Bob meaningfully moves the needle in the direction xmit was always meant to head — an effort to simplify putting sites on the web.

The `xmit` CLI isn't going anywhere. Professional organizations should still rely on CI/CD pipelines for deployment. The CLI is a wonderful tool for people comfortable taming it.

But for everyone else, Oncle Bob opens the door to a dramatically better experience around static sites. Now I can write guides for starting a blog on a fully self-managed stack without worrying that mandatory command-line usage will scare readers away.

I don't know that I'll write such guides myself anytime soon. In the meantime, I loved reading [Adam's guide](https://www.adamdjbrett.com/blog/deploying-eleventy-xmit/), which reminded me that DNS is another pain point worth addressing.
